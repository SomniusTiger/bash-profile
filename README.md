bash-profile
============

Custom .bash_profile which customizes how my terminal looks.

Mainly adjusts colors of certain things (file directory, git branch) but also plays sounds when some aliases are used. 

Currently I'm using lines from <a href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Turret_voice_lines">Portal 2's Turret dialogue</a> that you'll need to put in the right folder for it to work. Just drag the "sounds" folder into your Documents folder and you'll be good.

Most of the colorization was taken from somewhere else, but I don't really know from where as I got the code from a friend. If someone knows, I'd love to know whose it is!

Thanks, and enjoy!
