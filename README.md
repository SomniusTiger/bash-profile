bash-profile
============

<img src="README_IMG.png" width="100%" />

Custom .bash_profile which customizes how the terminal looks. It gives a simplistic readout of who and where you are when navigating around on your machine.

Most of the colorization was taken from somewhere else, but I don't really know from where as I got the code from a friend. If someone knows, I'd love to know whose it is!

Thanks, and enjoy!
